						Transparent electronics, Lisa Frank folders, the Ronald McDonald
						bench where he hugs you only as much as you want; lost to time as
						businesses shifted further away from unique identities in attempt to
						suit everyone's sensibilities - which in turn reach nobody. Why did
						companies abandon their mascots and logos? Are they scared to be
						vulnerable? Are they desparate to be liked? Reads like someone who
						needs therapy. But hey, corporations aren't people - do we even care
						about their image? -- Yeah, probably. The oversaturation of
						corporate social media accounts dogpiling dead trends and
						"relatable" content makes us cringe. Few and far between are posts
						authentic enough to reach viewers - but they do reach us, because
						they feel like real people. This stark contrast between "perfect",
						faceless corps and authentic, flawed people engenders desire to
						support brands with personable identities; marketing for some, not
						all. Dedicating your brand to a single community drives business
						engagement because it feels personal. Hot Topic is a killer example
						of stand-out branding that represented a new alternative culture
						(before devolving into just another store for everyone). -- Pick a
						lane what we choose to buy and use are often extensions of our
						identity and help define who we are. identity is defined but who
						doesn't relate or like it. wearing a star wars shirt is safe and
						represents nothing because everyone likes star wars - but wearing a
						design someone doesnt like separates your identiy from theirs, thus
						granting individuality. and everyone wants to be singularly
						individual. The changes seemed to happen so gradually that they went
						unnoticed until we found ourselves surrounded by the cultural
						grayification - but I suppose that's how history always plays out.
						People are becoming more aware of the sorely lacking whimsy that
						once underpinned the commercial success of American businesses. the
						public are becoming more aware or maybe its the oversaturation of
						perfection/minimalism that (pendulums) animal-shaped furniture,
						mascots, the decline sucks usability, accessibility the pendulum
						swings sites still suck tho boring minimalism but corporations arent
						people productivity and efficiency fear of vulnerability
						sterilizaton of business small businesses have the opportunity to
						create an authentic identity to compete with big brands
						grayification even in homes, archtecture of buildings how tech
						identity across multiple platforms may have caused this merge

					<h2>Why a Blog?</h2>

					<p>
						Figured it was time to document some of the projects, experiments,
						and random thoughts that come up while building stuff. Nothing too
						formal—just notes and observations.
					</p>

					<h3>What to Expect</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>Web dev techniques and tricks I pick up along the way</li>
						<li>Thoughts on design, UX, and user experience</li>
						<li>Project breakdowns and case studies</li>
						<li>Occasional deep dives on interesting problems</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						No set schedule. Posts happen when there's something worth sharing.
					</p>

					<h2>The Tech Stack</h2>

					<p>
						This blog runs on <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank"
							>Astro</a
						>, keeping it simple and fast. Static generation, minimal
						JavaScript, maximum performance.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						"The best code is the code you don't have to write."
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Each post is just an <code>.astro</code> file. No database, no complex
						CMS—just files and git commits. Clean, version-controlled, and easy to
						maintain.
					</p>

					<h2>Stay Tuned</h2>

					<p>
						More posts coming soon. If you want to get in touch about projects
						or just want to chat about web dev, hit me up at <a
							href="mailto:web@xaaane.com">web@xaaane.com</a
						>.
